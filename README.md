Hello guice, it's my SOAP project on Spring 3.1.2

This time I learned how to send SOAP requests and how to receive them.

If you open the project, you may wonder what is the difference from what is shown on spring.io/guides ?
And that's a good question to which I have an answer.

Initially after reading and implementing what was written there, I didn't understand anything, at all.

After that I wandered around the internet for a couple of days looking for an explanation of what wsdl is, why it is needed, why so few people talk about it, where are the 2023 or at least 2022 guides, why all the guides on this technology are from Indians.

 - I watched a lot of videos, and in the current one I added a little bit from each project.
 - I wrote an xsd file,
 - generated data from it.
 - Understood how to generate wsdl
 - Understood what SOAP is
 - I write a second service that sends a request here and receives a response.
 - Familiarized myself with a lot of libraries while playing with versions
